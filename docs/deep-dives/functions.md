# FUNCTIONs in Python  

## First Glance:

### Question 1: How Python Consider Functions?
C, in compiler's perspective, is a pattern of a series of operations. However, from programmer's perspective, there is almost no difference between a func and its return value. But what about Python?

> In the compiler's perspective, C can be viewed as a pattern of a series of operations, where functions are essential components represented by machine instructions. However, from a programmer's perspective, the distinction between a function and its return value is minimal, as functions can be manipulated, assigned, and used in a manner akin to return values, offering a high degree of flexibility in programming.
   
**Answer:** Python consider functions as first class object, which means it is more dymanic and focus not on the value, but on the process.
